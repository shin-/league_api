# league_api Python client - Documentation

This project is composed of two parts.

1. The first part is the client module, containing the Client class. This
class can be used to issue direct requests to the API and retrieve responses
in dict representation.

2. The second part is the objects module. It aims to be an object
representation of the data made available by the API. It uses the client
module to fetch data from the network.
